I think my side projects are a pretty good proof of that. But even if I lost interest in doing a certain activity I have always had the need for sharing what I love with other people.</p>\n<p>That’s why I’m making yet another blog.</p>\n<p>To bootstrap this one, I think it could be interesting to go over all my bigger past attempts at blogging and going over the good things I did and the wrong choices that I made, or why I quit those old blogs. I did have some other smaller attempts but I don’t think it’s worth speaking of those.</p>\n<p>I would like to start this by saying that this post is mostly a personal exercise to see what I should do and what I should avoid with this new project, so don’t expect any deep-introspective analysis or a thoughtful conclusion. This is just a rant of stuff I liked and stuff I didn’t.</p>\n<h3>Tsuna blog</h3>\n<p>This was my first attempt at blogging (at least the first I can remember). I started this around 2009 and the content was just small reviews about whatever anime or game I finished watching/playing.</p>\n<p>Being that my first blog experience, it wasn’t very good. Most posts were listing the things I enjoyed without actually trying to give any insight or actually making a point at all. Even so, I think the most important lesson that I learned from that was that blogging was fun and that I enjoyed telling others about the topics I love.</p>\n<p>It lasted for about four or five months with about a post each one or two weeks in average before starting to slowly die and about 8-9 months in, I just stopped. I don’t think there was actually a concrete reason about why I stopped, I just lose the interest in it after a while.</p>\n<h3>AoiTsu’s blog</h3>\n<p>On january of 2011 I was into this local (now dead) j-culture forum called Ikou-Kaisho. I was a forum mod and I had a good time posting content there. I did it so much that I wanted to start posting on my own, outside that community, and that’s how AoiTsu’s blog came into existence.</p>\n<p>It first started as a simple news blog. I just posted translations whenever I came across some cool news in an anime news specialized site like ANN or, and I feel bad having done this, SankakuComplex. While this was entertaining, soon I stopped thinking of it as a fun activity and it became just something to keep me busy.</p>\n<p>In april that year, around 3 months after having started, I decided to upload a series (Haiyore! Nyaruko, the flash one) that was on a MP4 format compatible with the PSP.</p>\n<p>For those of you who didn’t know about that, back in the pre-smartphone era, the PSP was one of the most popular media devices for watching videos, at least in Latin America, due to it being a game console + video player + music player + browser all-in-one; in a market where the closest alternative, the iPod video, was too expensive (and had a more limited format support) and the chinese rip-offs were too unreliable and not as cheap as nowadays. This kind of context is important because when I started posting anime for the PSP, was just in an era where fansubs and community re-encodes were the most common way to get anime and the PSP was one of the most popular media devices.</p>\n<p>So I started uploading more series and also published the same post on MCAnime (the biggest latin american community back in the days) with links to the blog, so you could get other anime series that I’ve had uploaded, which boosted the visits to the blog. At the same time, I spent so much time encoding the videos and building the blog posts that I stopped doing news and focus only on the uploads.</p>\n<p>This went on for a couple months until I started having issues with blogger slowing down, post formats were getting messed up whenever I tried to edit them, missing links, etc. So around August I moved all the uploads to a new host, wordpress, where it was hosted until it died.</p>\n<p> At that time, I had a pretty good computer and spent a lot of time playing around with encoding settings, which eventually allowed my releases to had an HD quality while keeping the size around 40-50mb per episode, when the standard size that other uploaders had for PSP releases was around 55-70mb for HQ quality. Keep in mind that this was when having 100kb/s download was the norm and most PSP users had only 2-4 GB to store games, music and videos; so saving 10-20mb was really huge in those times, specially if the quality was better than those with a bigger size).</p>\n<p>Once settled up in wordpress, the blog grow even faster, with people accessing and following the blog directly instead of through MCAnime. I also had develop a great workflow for downloading, encoding, uploading and publishing new episodes; so I was uploading several (around 10-15) airing episodes + 1 full series + 1-2 OVAs and music PVs per week.</p>\n<p>As the months went by, I grew up to being one of the most popular uploaders in the psp anime community, and my blog ended up becoming a whole project, at the point I had 3 active uploaders just for my blog and also came to become part of a network of uploaders.</p>\n<p>I won’t go into the details of this period, because it has enough stories for 2-3 long posts by itself but the important takeaways there were that helping others is fun and that I could really have an impact in other’s persons life by doing what I love.</p>\n<p>AoiTsu’s blog died in 2013, after a year and a half of constant uploading. It died because of 2 reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>My last PSP’s battery died (so I had no way to test what I was encoding, nor a reason to personally keep encoding anime).</li>\n<li>Megaupload’s dead, which accounted for 95% of the links at that moment, really hit me hard. This was my bad because I really didn’t want to move to hosting services that capped the bandwidth or that required downloaders to wait between downloads, and the other option, Mediafire, was bad at organizing files at that time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>AoiTsu’s blog is to me one of the most special side-projects I’ve done in my life. Not only because how it evolved on its own naturally, but because it allowed me to meet a lot of great people and gave me the opportunity to contribute to the anime community in Latin America. This was super important to me, because it teached me to help others with whatever you can, even if it’s a small contribution, as well as being grateful for the work other people do, teachings that until this day I still keep preaching to others.</p>\n<h3>Blue weeaboo</h3>\n<p>Around mid-2014 I felt again like writing about anime again so I went and created Blue Weeaboo. I was kinda tired of my period as uploader so I went for a blog where I could just write my experience with each anime season as well as going around related topics in-between the end of each season as a way to express myself.</p>\n<p>There’s not much to talk about here, but it was fun for the year it lasted. I also learned to put my thoughts together as well as getting a grasp of how to structure different kind of blog posts.</p>\n<p>I think in it’s core, Blue weeaboo was the closest attempt to what I want this new project to become, in the sense that I can speak about personal weeb-related stuff while not having to care about what people want me to produce or talk about.</p>\n<h3>YayuJS / Yayu/BLOG</h3>\n<p>On mid 2015, the javascript community was going at full speed all the time. Each couple days there was a new library or tool being released and there was just too many stuff to pick and learn. But this was a constantly changing environment, so it became pretty hard to notice which tools were actually good and useful in the long term and which ones were just hyped fads that will die one week after released. Due to this, the tutorials and learning material produced was limited because no one wanted to put time into writing something for a technology that could never matter.</p>\n<p>This problem was even worse for the spanish-speaking community as the content that was being produced or even translated was limited to well-tested technologies. Meaning that unless a library was backed by an important company (like <code>react</code>) or old enough (like <code>express</code> or <code>angular</code>), there was close to 0 chances of getting anything at all. And even those when they got something, it was several months after it became popular and sometimes with patterns that were no longer considered as “best pratices”.</p>\n<p>That stuck with me for several months and at the start of 2016, after several small attempts, I came with a blog to try and improve this and that’s how YayuJS came to be. This was more of a technical blog with tutorials and explanations about web related topics as they gained traction in the community. Basically whenever there was a new trend I felt passionate about I’ll write about it to try and introduce spanish speakers to it.</p>\n<p>Compared to the other blog’s styles, that were either <em>“write whatever your want”</em> or <em>“just fill this template”</em>, this one had been the hardest to produce due to not only require a post-specific structure but also having to take into account what parts will be harder to understand, which ones require examples/demos and trying to keep the big picture always in sight, this while trying to keep it the shortest as possible so people don’t get bored or feel like they are following a book tutorial instead of a post.</p>\n<p>This blog is still going after 1.5 years with an average rate of 3 posts per month, mostly because they require a lot of time and effort to research, write the demos, test them and edit the post (and test all again!!). It has teach me to put more though into what I’m writing and what are the core ideas I want to share with each post, as well as putting myself on the other end and trying to empathize with the reader.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>And that’s about it.</p>\n<p>Like I said before, this new blog purpose is just to share my point of view on certain topics and personal events. So in that regard it will be pretty similar to Blue Weeaboo but with a more personal style rather than trying to appeal others. I’m by no means new to this, but I’m going to take it easy so mistakes are bound to happen and I hope you can deal with that.</p>\n<p>With that said, I don’t feel like writing a proper conclusion so thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy the content on this site :)</p>",frontmatter:{title:"I'm not sure why I keep doing blogs",date:"September 12, 2017"}}},pathContext:{path:"/blog-history"}}}});
